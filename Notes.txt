VUE NOTES

   -Will freeze the value means it cannot be edited
      Object.freeze(obj)
 
   -Can change the value by using thus
   <button v-on:click="foo = 'baz'">Change it</button>
   
   -You can also perform one-time interpolations that do not update on data change by using the v-once directive, but keep in mind this will also affect any other bindings on the same node:
   
   -The double mustaches interprets the data as plain text, not HTML. In order to output real HTML, you will need to use the v-html directive:
   
   <p>Using mustaches: {{ rawHtml }}</p>
   <p>Using v-html directive: <span v-html="rawHtml"></span></p>
