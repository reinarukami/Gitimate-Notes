Hi Riziel Tipon, 

This is regarding the late submission of my leave forms. 

I apologize for the inconvenience that I have caused. I admit that I am liable for this since I have forgotten to file my leaved as I focuses on performing my daily tasks. 

It was an honest mistake that I am willing to admit. In addition, the said leaves were approved by my respective team leaders (Randy, Lawrence) via skype/messenger. 

Also, regarding the medical certificates for my recurring illnesses, medical certificates were not issued since medical consultations were not sought due to the fact that the illnesses I have acquired could be managed at home merely via bedrest and palliative measures with the advice of relatives and friends who are in the medical field. 

I seek medical consultation only for a more severe type of illness for which I do not have.

For most of my illnesses acquired, most of it were mild and acute ones (sudden onset) only which can easily be treated with palliative measures in the absence of extensive pharmacologic measures, therefore, no medical consulations were sought.

As an employee, I am merely using my privelege to utilize my leaves (sick leaves) whenever necessary but rest assured that i will try my best to be compliant with my filing, otherwise, I am aware that it will result into consequences.


Regards,
