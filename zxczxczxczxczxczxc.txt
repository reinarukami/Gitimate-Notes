Good day Riziel Tipon, 

This is regarding the late submission of my leave forms. 

I apologize for the inconvenience that I've caused and I admit that I am liable for it due to the fact that I have forgotten to file my leaves since I am often too focused on my daily tasks to finish the work before the due date. 

It was an honest mistake that I am willing to admit. In addition, the said leaves were approved by my respective team leaders (Randy, Lawrence) via skype/messenger. 

Also regarding not giving medical certificates in my recurring illness, Medical certificates were not issued since medical consultations were not sought due to the fact that the illnesses I acquired could be managed at home via bedrest and palliative measures. I seek medical consultation for more severe and untreatable diseases for which I do not have. I acquired mild and acute illnesses and not severe ones. Therefore,  no medical consulations were sought. If ever needed for some purposes to consult a medical i will take a leave in one of my workdays for examination.

Rest assured that I will try to be compliant with my filing, otherwise, I am aware that it will be filed as an LWOP when I fail to do so. 

Yours Sincerely

Robin Christopher Sumalde
